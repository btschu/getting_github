## Objectives

- Learn how to make a simple API call from a JS file.

- [ ] Create an HTML page that displays a button that when click will call the github API.

- [ ] Add the onclick event handler to the button to trigger the API call.

- [ ] Create a Javascript file and link it to the HTML file.

- [ ] Write the asynchronous function to retrieve the user data

- [ ] Once the data comes back, display the Github user information on the HTML page.
